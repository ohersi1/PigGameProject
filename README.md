Pig is a simple dice game. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total,
but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. Whoever gets a total score of 16 or more first wins.


Things I learned or practiced in this project:

- DOM Manipulation for example how to select an HTML element using Javascript and change the text.
- How to manipulate classes so adding, removing and toggling of classes.
- How to generate random numbers between 1-6 for the dice using Math.floor function combined with Math.random.
- How to dynamically select the active player and change the active player's current score and total score.
- How to dynamically insert the right source image depending on what the roll of the dice was.
- Use a variable with boolean value to make the buttons unclickable after someone has won the game and thus the game is finished.
